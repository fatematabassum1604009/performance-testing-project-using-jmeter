Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for a test App https://thetestingworldapi.com.<br>
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://thetestingworldapi.com.  
<ul>
<li>100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 90 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6000.</li>
<li>500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 146 And Total Concurrent API requested: 30000.</li>
  <li>700 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 166 And Total Concurrent API requested: 42000.</li>
</ul>

While executed 500 concurrent request, found  12 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.08%. 

<b>Summary:</b> Server can handle almost concurrent 20000 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.<br><br>
<b>Report for Thread Count 700:</b><br>
